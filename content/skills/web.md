Full stack web development is my jam! I love to work with both front-end and
back-end technologies. It's always cool when new technologies come out and 
it's fun for me to learn them. I don't have a favourite stack since I believe
that's it's important to use the right tool for the job. However, I commonly
use these frameworks in my projects:

- React 
    - Material UI
- Flask 
- Docker
- PyQt (For native client applications)
