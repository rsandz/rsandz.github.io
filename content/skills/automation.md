It pays to be a *lazy* developer! I have a passion for automating mundane tasks
to improve productivity and developing mechanisms for my team to function more effetively. 
Underneath my belt are numerous tools such as:

- Python
- Bash
- Ansible
- Selenium

Some of my achievements include the following:

- I've spearheaded a device lab setup in Amazon Alexa to ensure my team has reliable access to E2E testing.
- Created automated integration, canary and load test for critical services to provide confidence in new changes.
- During the Covid 19 pandemic, I created the front-end to virtually view device status for a vehicular communication device.
