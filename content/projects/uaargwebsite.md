The University of Alberta Aerial Robotics Group's (UAARG) website is the forefront
for exposing the club to potential members and sponsors.

I designed the website from the ground up while making sure it satisfies the following criteria:

  - High discoverability and straightforward call-to-actions for new visitors.
  - Captures the essence of the club and what makes it an exciting team to join.
  - Mobile first responsive design.
